    <h1>Travelling in Depression</h1>
    <p>When I was very little, I caught the travel bug. It 
        started after my grandparents first brought me to their 
        home in France and I have now been to twenty-nine
         different countries. Each <br> has given me a unique learning
          experience.</p>
          
         
          <p> 
        At five, I <a href="http://www.marveled.com">marveled</a>  at the Eiffel Tower in the City of Lights.
             When I was eight, I 
            stood in the heart of Piazza San Marco
               feeding hordes of pigeons, then glided down Venetian waterways on
              sleek gondolas. At thirteen, I saw the ancient, megalithic structure of 
              Stonehenge and

            walked along the Great Wall of China, amazed that the
             thousand-year-old stones were still in place just as 
             it is in
              <a href="https://starzit.com">Starz University</a> <br>
              . </p>
              
            <p>It was through exploring cultures around the world that I first became
                 interested in language.
                It began with French, which taught me the importance of pronunciation.
                 I remember once asking a store owner in Paris where Rue des Pyramides was. 
                 
                 But when I pronounced it PYR–a–mides instead of pyr–A–mides, with more accent
                  on the A, she looked at me bewildered.
                In the eighth grade, I became fascinated with Spanish and aware
                 of its similarities with English through cognates. Baseball in Spanish,
                  for example, is béisbol, which looks different but sounds nearly the same. 
                  This was incredible to
                me as it made speech and comprehension more fluid, and even today
                 I find that cognates come to the rescue when I forget how to say 
                 something in Spanish. <a href="mailto:georgrnlindah642@gmail.com">Send Us Email</a> <br> 
                  
                Then, in high school, I developed an enthusiasm for
                 Chinese. As 
                studied Chinese at my school, I marveled how if
                 just one stroke was missing from a character
                 , the meaning is lost. <br>
                  I I
                 loved how long words were formed by combining simpler characters, 
                 so Huǒ (火) meaning fire and Shān (山) meaning mountain can be joined to
                  create Huǒshān (火山), which means volcano. <br> I love spending hours at a time
                   practicing the characters and
                  I can feel the beauty and rhythm as I form them.</p><br><br><br><br><br>
